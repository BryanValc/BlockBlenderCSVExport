# BlockBlenderCSVExport

Before you go straight and download it, please consider supporting this project, as it took me many days of almost 0 sleep, you can support it here:

<br>
I need all the extra help I can get, because I didn't imagine this could turn into something this big, and there can be endless implementations, if you think you can contribute with at least one commit to this project, I would gladly give you a 100% affiliate code on gumroad (I still need to think of an easier and more fair method, but this is the best idea that came to my mind just now) send me a discord message: EpicSpartanRyan#8948

This is a script that exports the blocks

to a fully usable .schem minecraft file that can be placed in seconds

by adding an export option for the context menu
<br>

that lets you pick a destination folder and file name, it will export ONLY the instances of the SELECTED object,
<br>

<br>
note that all the TRANSFORMS must be APPLIED so it can work properly (by default, select the object, then press CTRL+A, the menu will be displayed)
<br>
